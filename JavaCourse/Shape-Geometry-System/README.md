# Shape Geometry System

## Overview
An object-oriented geometry system demonstrating abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism with various shapes.

## Classes
- **Shape**: Abstract base class with dimensions and abstract area calculation method
- **Rectangle**: Concrete class for rectangle area calculation
- **Triangle**: Concrete class for triangle area calculation
- **Circle**: Concrete class for circle area calculation
- **Picture**: Container class that aggregates multiple shapes
- **Main**: Driver class demonstrating polymorphism

## Features
- Abstract shape hierarchy
- Calculate areas for different shapes
- Polymorphic behavior
- Sum total areas of multiple shapes
- Clean object-oriented design

## Topics Covered
- Abstract classes and methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Method overriding
- Geometric calculations
- Object composition
- Encapsulation
- Constructor usage

## How to Run
```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```
